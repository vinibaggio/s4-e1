    #           "a" = any time; "r"=early morning; "m"=morning;
    #           "12"=noon; "n"=afternoon; "e"=evening; "l"=night
    #  return_time -> see depart_time
    #  travelers -> integer from 1-8
    #  cabin -> f, b or e(default) (first, business, economy/coach)
    #  action -> must be "doFlights"
    #  apimode -> must be "1"
    #  _sid_ -> the Session ID you get from GetSession
    #  version -> The version of the API the client is expecting. The only current supported version is "1"
